# Internationalization

The current default language for `BFUI` documentation is Chinese, other languages are jointly maintained by the community.

In addition to the Chinese document, the content in other languages may have lagging translation work and inaccurate word meanings. If you are interested in contributing a new language version of this document, or improving and correcting existing translations, you can go to the repository to submit an [Issue](https://github.com/BF-Teams/bfui-vue/issues) and let us know.
