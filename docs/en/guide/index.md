BFUI is a Vue3-based front-end component library that helps design developers improve their work efficiency.

The initial development team is a group of college students who love development. The purpose is to learn and grow in the open source ecosystem of co-construction and sharing. We also look forward to building a brilliant code world with everyone! ðŸŽ‰
